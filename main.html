    <h2>What is "MODERN DENTISTRY"?</h2>
    <article class="article">
      <p>
      Simply put, modern dentistry is a mindset. Dentistry is no longer is just
      telling people to brush and floss more. A Modern Dentist has a modern
      TEAM. We recognize that consistent training in modern techniques attracts
      and keeps great people beside you, as part of this team. The modern
      dentist relies on the input and experience of the team to perform and
      execute at a very high level; creating an environment where the patient
      doesn’t just have a good experience, but and experience that goes so far
      beyond what is normal in the dentistry world. A modern dentist is an
      oral/facial specialist that utilizes the latest technology to build
      beautiful, healthy smiles and change people’s lives. Really… modern
      dentistry is an evolution. It’s an Experience.
      </p>
      <h2>How do you know if your dentist is a Modern Dentist?</h2>
      <p class="picture">
      One of the easiest was to know, is by looking at what kind of technology
      they have at their disposal. Are they committed to using the absolute
      best? Film X-rays, goopy impressions, needles, and clunky devices… are all
      a thing of the past! There are some incredible tools available to us now,
      and here at The Libby Group, we are able to use them to make the patient
      experience so much better!
